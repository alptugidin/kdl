      <div class="subtitle is-6">By using or visiting KDramaLike, these terms will automatically apply to you – you
        should make sure
        therefore that you read them carefully before using the website. You’re not allowed to copy or modify
        the website, any part of the website, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
        extract the source code of the website, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the website into other
        languages or make derivative versions. The website itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database
        rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to kdramalike.com.
      </div>

      <div class="subtitle is-6">kdramalike.com is committed to ensuring that the website is as useful and efficient as
        possible. For that
        reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the website or to charge for its services, at any time
        and for any reason. We will never charge you for the website or its services without making it very
        clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
      </div>

      <div class="subtitle is-6">The kdramalike.com website stores and processes personal data that you have provided to
        us, to provide
        our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the website secure. We therefore
        recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software
        restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your
        phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it
        could mean that the kdramalike.com website won’t work properly or at all.
      </div>

      <div class="subtitle is-6">You should be aware that there are certain things that kdramalike.com will not take
        responsibility for.
        Certain functions of the website will require the website to have an active internet connection. The
        connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but kdramalike.com cannot take
        responsibility for the website not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and
        you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
      </div class="subtitle is-6">

      <div class="subtitle is-6">
        If you’re using the website outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the
        agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
        mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the website, or
        other third-party charges. In using the website, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges,
        including roaming data charges if you use the website outside of your home territory (i.e. region or
        country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
        using the website, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer
        for using the website.
      </div>

      <div class="subtitle is-6">
        Along the same lines, kdramalike.com cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the website
        i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn
        it on to avail the Service, kdramalike.com cannot accept responsibility.
      </div>

      <div class="subtitle is-6">With respect to kdramalike.com’s responsibility for your use of the website, when
        you’re using the
        website, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and
        correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it
        available to you. kdramalike.com accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience
        as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the website.
